# Bedrock Gophers

Welcome to the Bedrock Gophers organization! We are dedicated to creating easy-to-use libraries that extend the functionality of Dragonfly, a versatile framework for Minecraft server development. Our libraries aim to enhance various aspects of server customization, from handling player packets to implementing advanced entity behavior and more.

## Libraries

### 1. Packethandler

**Description:** Packethandler is a library designed to simplify the handling of player packets within a Minecraft server. It provides an intuitive interface for intercepting, inspecting, and manipulating packets sent and received by players.

### 2. Living

**Description:** Living offers tools for creating and managing living entities within the Minecraft world. Whether you're spawning custom mobs or adding unique behaviors to existing ones, Living provides an easy-to-use framework for implementing complex entity logic.

### 3. Spawner

**Description:** Spawner is an implementation of working mob spawners for Minecraft servers. It allows server administrators to create custom spawner configurations and control mob spawning behavior with ease.

### 4. Inv

**Description:** Inv provides an implementation of a fake-inventory system for Minecraft servers. It allows developers to create custom inventories with arbitrary contents and behaviors, enabling the creation of unique gameplay mechanics and user interfaces.

## Getting Started
